# Design Guidelines: User Directory Application

## Design Approach

**Selected System:** Material Design  
**Rationale:** This utility-focused application prioritizes data readability, efficient filtering, and clear information hierarchy. Material Design provides robust patterns for data display, search interfaces, and loading states that align perfectly with these requirements.

**Core Principles:**
- Information clarity over visual embellishment
- Immediate data accessibility
- Intuitive search and filter experience
- Responsive data presentation across devices

## Typography System

**Font Family:** Roboto (Material Design standard via Google Fonts CDN)

**Hierarchy:**
- **Page Title:** 32px, Medium weight (500)
- **Section Headers:** 24px, Medium weight (500)
- **User Names:** 18px, Medium weight (500)
- **User Details (email, phone, company):** 14px, Regular weight (400)
- **Labels & Metadata:** 12px, Regular weight (400)
- **Search Input:** 16px, Regular weight (400)

## Layout System

**Spacing Units:** Tailwind units of 2, 4, 6, and 8 for consistent rhythm
- Micro spacing (within cards): p-4, gap-2
- Card spacing: p-6
- Section spacing: py-8, gap-6
- Container margins: mx-4, md:mx-8, lg:mx-auto

**Container Structure:**
- Max width: max-w-7xl
- Responsive padding: px-4 md:px-8
- Centered layout: mx-auto

**Grid System:**
- Mobile: Single column (grid-cols-1)
- Tablet: Two columns (md:grid-cols-2)
- Desktop: Three columns (lg:grid-cols-3)
- Card grid gap: gap-6

## Component Library

### Search Bar
**Placement:** Fixed at top of page, sticky position during scroll  
**Structure:**
- Full-width container with max-w-7xl constraint
- Input field with search icon (Material Icons: search)
- Height: h-14
- Rounded corners: rounded-lg
- Prominent shadow for depth: shadow-md
- Clear/reset button (X icon) appears when text is entered

### User Cards
**Layout:** Elevated card design with consistent structure

**Card Anatomy:**
- Rounded corners: rounded-lg
- Elevation: shadow-lg with hover elevation increase
- Internal padding: p-6
- Vertical content flow with gap-3

**Content Order (top to bottom):**
1. Avatar placeholder (w-16 h-16, rounded-full, first letter of name)
2. User name (primary emphasis)
3. Username (@username format, subtle emphasis)
4. Email (with envelope icon)
5. Phone (with phone icon)
6. Company name (with building icon)
7. Address (city only, with location icon)
8. Website link (with link icon, truncated if long)

**Icons:** Material Icons via CDN - use outlined variant for consistency

### Loading State
**Display:** Centered in viewport
- Circular spinner (Material Design circular progress)
- Size: w-12 h-12
- Below spinner: "Loading users..." text (14px)
- Centered container with flex layout

### Empty State (No Results)
**Display:** Centered message when search returns no results
- Search icon (large, w-16 h-16)
- "No users found" heading (24px)
- Suggestion text: "Try adjusting your search" (14px)
- Vertical spacing: gap-4

### Error State
**Display:** Centered alert with retry option
- Error icon (warning/error icon, w-16 h-16)
- Error message heading (20px)
- Descriptive text about the issue (14px)
- Retry button (elevated, rounded-lg)

---

## Responsive Behavior

**Mobile (< 768px):**
- Single column card layout
- Search bar: Full width with compact height (h-12)
- Cards: Full width with reduced padding (p-4)
- Avatar size: Reduced to w-12 h-12

**Tablet (768px - 1024px):**
- Two-column card grid
- Search bar: Maintains full width
- Standard card padding (p-6)
- Avatar size: w-16 h-16

**Desktop (> 1024px):**
- Three-column card grid
- Maximum container width enforced (max-w-7xl)
- Full card specifications apply
- Hover effects enabled (elevation increase, subtle scale transform)

---

## Interaction Patterns

**Search Input:**
- Focus state: Increased border emphasis, no outline ring
- Debounced filtering (300ms) for performance
- Live results update as user types
- Placeholder: "Search users by name..."

**Card Hover (Desktop):**
- Subtle elevation increase (shadow-xl)
- Minimal scale transform (scale-105)
- Smooth transition: transition-all duration-200

**Clickable Elements:**
- Website links: Underline on hover
- Email/Phone: Click to copy functionality (with toast notification)

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- Minimum touch target size: 44x44px for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
- Semantic HTML (main, section, article tags)
- Keyboard navigation support for search and cards
- Focus indicators with sufficient contrast
- Screen reader announcements for loading/error states

---

## Performance Specifications

- Lazy load card images/avatars if implemented
- Virtual scrolling not required (API returns only 10 users)
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo for card components
- Debounce search input to minimize filtering operations

This design creates a clean, professional data directory that prioritizes usability and information clarity while maintaining visual polish through Material Design principles.
